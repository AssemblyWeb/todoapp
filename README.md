# TODO APP:

This APP is an interview challenge where in 6 days I builded a TODO with vanilla JS, SASS and any framework.

The application must be able to:

- Create a task that contains text and an optional "high priority" property
- Display highest priority tasks first in the list
- Mark a task as complete
- Delete a task

## TODO :

- [x] Interaction of menus on hover
- [ ] Color of the autocomplete according to the design system
- [ ] Animation of the strike-through when doing a task
- [ ] Error message when you want to add a task but the input is empty
- [ ] Success message when doing tasks in progress
- [x] Animation when deleting a task
- [ ] Ability to edit tasks
- [ ] Modal animation
- [ ] Save in localStorage to not lose data
- [ ] Modal refactor to unify the code
